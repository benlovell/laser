        Davis","info":"minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting\nTDD,
        BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.\n\n    \"I had a class with Jim Weirich on
        testing last week and we were\n     allowed to choose our testing frameworks.
        Kirk Haines and I were\n     paired up and we cracked open the code for a
        few test\n     frameworks...\n\n     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable
        / understandable\n     compared to the ''other two'' options we looked at.
        Nicely done and\n     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity.\"\n\n    --
        Wayne E. Seguin\n\nminitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing
        framework.\nIt provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean
        and\nreadable.\n\nminitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It
        hooks onto\nminitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec\nexpectations.\n\nminitest/benchmark
        is an awesome way to assert the performance of your\nalgorithms in a repeatable
        manner. Now you can assert that your newb\nco-worker doesn''t replace your
        linear algorithm with an exponential\none!\n\nminitest/mock by Steven Baker,
        is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)\nobject framework.\n\nminitest/pride
        shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test\noutput. I guess it
        is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P\n\nminitest/test is meant to
        have a clean implementation for language\nimplementors that need a minimal
        set of methods to bootstrap a working\ntest suite. For example, there is no
        magic involved for test-case\ndiscovery.\n\n    \"Again, I can''t praise enough
        the idea of a testing/specing\n     framework that I can actually read in
        full in one sitting!\"\n\n    -- Piotr Szotkowski\n\nComparing to rspec:\n\n    rspec
        is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.\n\n    -- Adam Hawkins, \"Bow Before MiniTest\"\n\nminitest
        doesn''t reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:\nclasses, modules,
        inheritance, methods. This means you only have to\nlearn ruby to use minitest
        and all of your regular OO practices like\nextract-method refactorings still
        apply.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"sha":"4bf1fcf3306977f97348ff3c46520191a853c2637628aea20db55c7035aa62fa","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-5.10.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/minitest/5.10.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~\u003e
